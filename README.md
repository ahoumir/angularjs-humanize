# angularjs-humanize

angularjs-humanize is a thin wrapper around the
[humanize](https://github.com/taijinlee/humanize) library, providing a
variety of Angular filters which apply transformations to make data more
human-readable.

## Supported Filters

angularjs-humanize currently supports the following features from
humanize:

+ _filesize_, which transforms a number or number-like string into
  a human-readable filesize such as "225.35 KB"
+ _ordinal_, which transforms an integer into an ordinal such as
  "32nd" or "101st"
+ _naturalDay_, which transforms an integer representing an epoch
  into a date representation or one of "yesterday", "today", or
  "tomorrow"
+ _relativeTime_, which transforms an integer representing an epoch
  into a string such as "about an hour ago" or "in a month"
